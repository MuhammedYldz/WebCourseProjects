<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello there! My name is Muhammed Yıldız.</p>
<p>I'm a person who wants to master the Web Development technologies. Here is my work experience as a Test Engineer.</p>
<p>With over 2,5 years of experience, I am actively seeking new opportunities, driven by a strong commitment to ensuring the quality of
  software products in all aspects. I have dedicated myself to this cause. My proactive approach and keen observational skills enable me
  to enhance both products and processes, even in challenging and fast-paced environments. These qualities fuel my motivation to learn
  and achieve more.</p>

<p>Over the past 2,5 years, I had the opportunity to work at Sestek as a Software Test Engineer, actively participating in both software
  development and testing phases. My involvement in various projects during this period not only enhanced my teamwork, problemsolving, and communication skills but also allowed me to take on significant responsibilities, particularly with the company's critical
  product, Conversational Analytics.

<p>In this role, I played a significant role in contributing to product development by conducting comprehensive tests using tools such as
  TFS. Additionally, I initiated and led the automation process within the company using Selenium, starting from scratch, and assumed a
  leadership position in this process. Like the company, I started from scratch in this area, learning and implementing the transition to
  automation. I automated approximately 54 different scenarios and nearly 700 test cases, covering not only fundamental aspects but
  also many end-to-end scenarios that were previously manually tested, I was also ensuring the quality and performance of the External
  API through testing and automation using Postman and JMeter. Additionally, I proactively identified analysis gaps and potential
  issues, opening issue tickets to address them. Furthermore, I assisted in installation tests and acceptance tests for other company
  products, showcasing my versatility, including proficiency with virtual machines like Hyper-V</p>
